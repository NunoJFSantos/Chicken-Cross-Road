# Chicken-Cross-Road
Java group project develped during the very beginning of my fullstack developer bootcamp in <Academia de Código_>. 

## The Project
We were challenged to develop a game in one week as the first team work project, having only aquired basic OOP concepts and low Java programming skills.
The main concept of this project was to create an entertaining and ready to play game, having access to a simple graphics library. After one long week we came up with this funny game where the simple goal is to cross the road as many times as possible without being ran over by any car.

## Instructions
To play the game turn up the volume and run the command:

```java -jar ChickenFinal/build/ChickenCrossTheRoad.jar```
